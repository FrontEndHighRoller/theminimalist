                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why I Decided to Climb Kilimanjaro</h2>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    I hadn’t originally planned to summit Africa’s tallest peak.
                    I was relaxing on the beaches of Zanzibar, soaking up the <strong>30°C heat</strong> and stunning
                    sunsets.
                    It was beautiful — but honestly, I started getting a little bored.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    So I pulled out my phone and searched for other things to do in Tanzania. Safari tours came up
                    first.
                    But then I saw it: <strong>climbing Mount Kilimanjaro</strong>. That was it — the most spontaneous
                    decision I’ve ever made.
                </p>

                <div class="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 bg-cyan-50 p-4 mb-6 text-sm text-gray-800">
                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Setting:</strong> On a bumpy bus ride from Nungwi to Stone Town port.</p>
                    <p>I checked flights. There was a 3 PM departure to Arusha — available. I booked it right at the
                        airport.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The office had ice-cold air conditioning, so I didn’t mind waiting. Others slowly arrived.
                    I chatted with a guy next to me — turns out, <strong>he was the pilot</strong>.
                    I asked if I could film Kilimanjaro from the cockpit. He said yes.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    That flight gave me some of the <strong>most epic aerial footage</strong> I’ve ever captured.
                    Once we landed in Arusha, there were no taxis or buses. So I walked to the main road and flagged a
                    local minibus.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    While on the bus, a drunk man tried to sell me a trek. I smiled and ignored him.
                    But once I got off — boom. A crowd surrounded me, <strong>all pitching Kilimanjaro
                        packages</strong>.
                    I told them I’d already done the hike just to get by.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    After finally reaching my accommodation, I started digging deeper.
                    Most tours focused on safaris or visiting Maasai villages — but not Kilimanjaro.
                    I decided to head deeper into town the next day.
                </p>

                <div class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 p-4 mb-6 text-sm text-gray-800">
                    <p><strong>Turning Point:</strong> I randomly bumped into a local operator during lunch.
                        His honesty and passion lit a spark.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    That afternoon, I asked around at the guesthouse and did more research.
                    I ended up booking the trek with that same guy I’d just met.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-800 font-medium">
                    Maybe it was spontaneity. Maybe fate. Either way — that’s how I decided to climb Kilimanjaro.

                    Why I Chose the Marangu Route
                </h2>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    I chose the <strong>Marangu Route</strong> for a few simple but important reasons:
                </p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-800 text-sm space-y-2 pl-2">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hut accommodation:</strong> It’s the <em>only route</em> on Kilimanjaro where you don’t
                        need to camp.
                        Cozy mountain huts instead of tents? Yes, please.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>“Easiest” route?</strong> It’s often called that — but don’t be fooled.
                        <span class="italic">A 5-day climb is still intense</span> and physically demanding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Acclimatization matters:</strong> The 6-day version has a much better success rate.
                        I went with 5 days, which made altitude sickness more likely.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We reached <strong>Kibo Hut</strong> around noon on Day 3. That’s when the altitude really hit me.
                    A pounding headache set in — classic <strong>Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)</strong>.
                    I had no appetite, but I forced down water all afternoon.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We rested until <strong>11:30 PM</strong>, had a light meal, and then began the final summit push
                    under a star-lit sky.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                    The summit climb was absolutely brutal.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The trail was steep, the gravel loose — every step felt like sliding back two. We zigzagged to save
                    energy,
                    but by <strong>5,200 meters</strong>, I hit a wall. I was exhausted. I had to stop often, and even
                    vomited at one point.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Then came a <strong>30-minute rock scramble</strong>. My body was on the edge of shutting down.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 bg-blue-50 p-4 italic text-sm text-gray-800 mb-6">
                    “Keep moving,” Ayubu warned. “Or the cold will get you.”

                    His voice cut through my brain fog. I focused only on putting one foot in front of the other.
                    Eventually — somehow — I made it to <strong>Gilman’s Point</strong>.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    But that’s where I stopped. The snow was waist-deep. Uhuru Peak was an hour away.
                    <strong>Stella Point?</strong> Just 20 minutes.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    But I was done. I looked at Ayubu. He didn’t say a word — he didn’t need to.
                    We both knew: this was my finish line.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-2">No regrets.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Reaching Gilman’s Point was a victory. That night pushed me to my absolute physical and mental
                    limits.
                    I didn’t stand on the roof of Africa — but I touched its edge.
                    <strong>And that was enough.</strong>

                    <li>❄️ <strong>Sleeping bag</strong> (rated at least -10°C)</li>

                    <li>🔋 <strong>Power Bank</strong> (20,000mAh)</li>
                    <li>🍼 <strong>Water bottles</strong> (minimum 2L total)</li>
                    <li>🕶️ <strong>Sunglasses</strong> (UV-protected, glacier-grade if possible)</li>
                    <li>💄 <strong>Lip balm</strong> (high SPF — trust me, your lips will thank you)</li>
                    <li>🧴 <strong>Pee bottle</strong> (to avoid leaving your warm sleeping bag at night)</li>

                        <li><strong>💄 Don’t skimp on lip balm</strong> — my lips were wrecked after the hike, even
                            touching them hurt for a week!</li>
                        <li><strong>🧴 Pee bottle:</strong> I didn’t bring one, and I regretted it. You’ll be drinking
                            2–3L daily, which means night pees. Climbing out of your warm bag, layering up, and walking
                            to the toilet kills your sleep — and your energy the next day.</li>

                    The <strong>Marangu Route</strong> — nicknamed the <em>“Coca-Cola Route”</em> — takes 5 days and 4
                    nights with
                    overnight stays in <strong>mountain huts</strong>. It’s considered one of the more comfortable ways

                    Kilimanjaro.

                    <li>

                        <span class="block ml-6">They’ve summited dozens (if not hundreds) of times. Trust their pace,
                            advice, and timing — it’s what gets most people to the top safely.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        🐌 <strong>Don’t rush — even on the easy first days.</strong>
                        <span class="block ml-6">"Pole pole" (Swahili for “slowly slowly”) will become your mantra.
                            Stick to it.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        🏃‍♂️ <strong>Train with cardio, not just weights.</strong>
                        <span class="block ml-6">Running helps build lung efficiency and endurance. Add hill sprints or
                            intervals to prep for long days at altitude.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        🧗 <strong>Know the odds.</strong>
                        <span class="block ml-6">If you haven’t been at altitude before, the 5-day Marangu Route is a
                            fast ascent. Success rates are only around 50%.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        💊 <strong>Take altitude meds.</strong>
                        <span class="block ml-6">Acetazolamide (Diamox) is recommended 1–2 days before the hike if
                            you’re not acclimatised.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        💧 <strong>Hydrate well.</strong>
                        <span class="block ml-6">Drink 2–3L of water daily — it helps with acclimatization and
                            energy.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <span class="block ml-6">Boots, waterproofs, torches, and more are available if you’re missing
                            anything.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        💄 <strong>Pack lip balm.</strong>
                        <span class="block ml-6">Trust me — windburned lips can last for weeks and hurt more than you
                            think.</span>
