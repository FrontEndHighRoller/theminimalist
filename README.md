## 👀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Dark-themed, modern UI built with Tailwind CSS  
- Hero section with autoplay background video for an immersive experience  
- Interactive world map highlighting visited countries  
- Visual galleries of favourite travel spots  
- Travel guides, packing lists, and curated tips for backpacking  
- Experimenting with multi-page HTML structure with dynamic components (header/footer)  
- Designed as a stepping stone toward a future Next.js project
